#Starting code bundle
Unfinished as of 01/25/2017.

Overview of the project can be seen in README.ipynb

particleController.py contains all methods that can be called to create datasets, visualize particles, hits, and detectors, and create pathing reconstructions from datasets that can be imported using methods in the particleController.

oogenerateParticles.py - Particle data type and methods 
oogenerateHits.py - Hit data type and methods
oogenerateDetectors.py - Detector data type and methods

Rest is either test code or helper code.
